# About

In response to the unprecedented global crisis we face with the Covid-19 pandemic, we have built a very simple system that helps to keep at-risk people safe from SARS COV-2 infection.

# BACKGROUND
Many community members are at high risk of illness or death from Covid-19 including age, underlying illnesses, and other factors. Activities such as grocery shopping, retrieving medication from the pharmacy, and generally being in crowded spaces indoors make them more prone to infection from Covid-19 that in some cases could be fatal.
In every neighborhood in the USA, there are kind hearted volunteers who are willing to help their neighbors with these tasks. High risk members of our community need our help to shelter in place while still being able to go about their lives normally.

# WHO WE ARE
On March 31, 2020, in less than a week, some very talented individuals in Northern Virginia (part of the DC Maryland Virginia Metro Area) set up a system that links high-risk people requiring assistance with people willing to volunteer their time to run errands on their behalf.
This incredible network was made possible with the help of our local Trader Joe's and in consultation with the Fairfax County Health Department.
Working cooperatively as a team, we have developed a system that coordinates the shopping needs of our at-risk community members with the available and willing volunteers.

# OUR SYSTEM
This simple, uncomplicated system was designed for use by the elderly who are not very tech savvy. It responds rapidly to the needs of our community members and ensures that volunteers who help them are trained to follow all relevant infection prevention and social distancing protocols as set out by local health authorities. That keeps everyone safe by helping to stop the spread.
We have put all the materials we developed on this website, and we invite all communities in the United States to download and make use of them. Please consult with your local health department to include information specific to your region.

# CONTACT
If you have any questions, suggestions, or need further assistance customizing our materials, please contact us at volunteers@twistysystems.com. We will be happy to speak with you by phone, video conference or email to help setup your coordinated mechanism.
